Password Generator

I created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
```
AN employee with access to sensitive data will be able to randomly generate a password that meets the below criteria so that they can create a strong password that provides greater security.
```


When the user clicks the button to generate a password.
Then they are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
When prompted for password criteria.
They select which criteria to include in the password.
When prompted for the length of the password.
Then they choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password.
Then they choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
When they answer each prompt
Then their input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
WHEN all prompts are answered.
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
WHEN the password is generated.
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
```

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
